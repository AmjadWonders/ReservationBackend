## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmjadWonders/ReservationBackend.git
   cd ReservationBackend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Setup the database**
   Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running. You can use MongoDB Atlas or a local MongoDB instance.

4. **Configure environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://0.0.0.0:27017/reservationbackend
   PORT=3000
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The server will start on port 3000 by default. You can change the port by updating the `PORT` environment variable.

2. **API Endpoints**
   * **Get all movies**
     ```
     GET /movies
     ```
   * **Check availability**
     ```
     GET /movies/:movieId/slots/:slotId/availability
     ```
   * **Reserve a time slot**
     ```
     POST /movies/:movieId/slots/:slotId/reserve
     ```
     **Request Body:**
     ```json
     {
       "numberOfPeople": 5
     }
     ```

## Running Tests

1. **Install testing dependencies**
   Testing dependencies are included in `package.json`, so you only need to install them by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the tests**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   This will run the tests defined in `tests/movieRoutes.test.js` using Jest.
